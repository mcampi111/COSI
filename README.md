## **Abstract**

**Background**: Hearing loss affects 1.5 billion people globally, including over 50\% of French individuals aged 65 and older. Traditional assessment like tonal and speech gains fail to capture the broader impact on daily life. Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs), such as the COSI questionnaire, provide personalized insights to enhance patient care. This study integrates Natural-Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze COSI data, assessing PROMs' benefit in audiology and the specific needs of hearing-impaired patients in France. \\

**Methods**: We conducted a population-based, cross-sectional, comparative analysis with 190,213 adults with symmetric hearing loss in France, collecting data between September 2020 and December 2022. Expert-labeled data trained a CamemBERT model, achieving 97\% accuracy in labeling the remaining responses. Advanced regression analysis examined the contributions of speech tests, age, sex, and COSI responses to pure-tone average (PTA) hearing loss categories. \\

**Findings**: Patients with slight hearing loss and those aged 40-49 prioritize understanding speech in noise, highlighting the need for early testing and speech-in-noise assessments. Females emphasize social and emotional aspects earlier than males. NLP integration into clinical systems can improve policies and interventions for hearing loss.\\

**Interpretation**: Incorporating PROMs in audiology provided significant benefits in assessing patient needs, surpassing the limitations of audiograms and speech tests alone. The analysis of responses across the COSI enabled a nuanced understanding of individual hearing difficulties and rehabilitation goals.\\

**Funding**: This research was funded by a grant from Fondation Pour lâ€™Audition (FPA) to Hung Thai-Van and Paul Avan, number FPA IDA09 and FPA IDA10.


## Contributions of the paper
The paper has the following contributions:
1. Assess the benefits of PROMs in audiology for evaluating patient experiences and outcomes, and the impact of hearing loss on individuals.
2. Utilize NLP techniques to analyze the specific needs and experiences of a subset of hearing-impaired patients in France, providing insights for tailored interventions and improved patient care.


## Motivations For this Study

Integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques into PROM analysis is increasingly recommended. NLP has been effectively applied across various health domains, demonstrating its potential to enhance the interpretation and utilization of patient feedback in clinical settings.

The importance of PROMs in capturing patient experiences and improving patient-professional communication is increasingly recognized. These tools improve care quality and aligning treatments with individual needs. In audiology, the COSI questionnaire exemplifies the value of personalized approaches to hearing difficulties. Additionally, integrating NLP techniques enables the analysis of PROMs data, offering deeper insights into patient needs and experiences. Building on these insights, this study aims to characterize hearing loss in France using PROMs
